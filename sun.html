    <h3><i>eCommerce on Your Terms</i><br>
Shopify makes it easy to accept and manage online <br> payments, but <i>only on their terms.</i><br>

For the ownership and freedom of open source, to <br> decide what works for you, build outside the box,<br> and customize without limits: try WooCommerce.<br>

    <h2>What to Expect from WooCommerce</h2>
    <div class="f1">
      <h3><i>Enjoy the Freedom of Open Source</i><br>
Shopify is a closed platform. There are limited <br> product variations, no sub-categories, no <br> options to migrate, and there <i> is nothing you <br> can do about it.</i><br>

WooCommerce offers the freedom of open <br> source. You have full code access and <br> ownership, the option to customize any aspect <br> of your site, and can integrate any service – <br> with complete control.<br>

Want to change something? <i>You can.</i></h3>

      <h3><i>Extra Functionality is Not Tied to Plans</i> <br>
     All of Shopify’s features are tied to their paid plans.<br>

For example, third-party shipping <br> rates and advanced report building are only available <br> in the Shopify Advanced plan at $299 per month.<br>

With WooCommerce, you can add any free or paid <br> extensions from our marketplace or beyond – when it <br> suits you.<br>

  <div class="f3">
    <h3><i>Built on the world’s best CMS</i> <br>
WooCommerce is built on WordPress, offering deep <br> integration with the world’s best content management <br> system and publishing tools. <br>

Updating your site’s content regularly is important for <br> SEO, and it’s simple with WordPress.<br>

This familiar framework is easy to learn, and manage <br> for store owners and content creators alike</h3>

  <h3><i>Bring Your Data With You</i> <br>
It’s easy to export your Shopify catalog and import <br> your products, orders, customers, categories, reviews, <br> and more into WooCommerce. Whether you’re <br> planning to grow large or just take the next step for a <br> side project, WooCommerce is flexible, so you can <br> build a solution for today that will scale.<br></h3>
